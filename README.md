Unity ZX-Spectrum Screen Loader v.0.2  
The package simulates the download of the ZX-Spectrum pictures with tape.
Attention! This is not an emulator of the ZX-spectrum platform, it just draws on the screen and sounds something like zx-spectrum did.

Loading files can occur both from local storage and via the Internet.

Contains:
- standard ZX-Spectrum font
- software representation of a hardware color palettes of Zx-Spectrum: Orthodox, Pulsar, Alone, Electroscale
- voxel model and unity prefab of ZX-Spectrum 48 & TV & tape recorder

Used asset to print into Texture2D - Pixel Tracery v.0.3

Have a fun =)
