Unity ZX-Spectrum Screen Loader v.0.2  
The package simulates the download of the ZX-Spectrum pictures with tape.
Attention! This is not an emulator of the ZX-spectrum platform, it just draws on the screen and sounds something like zx-spectrum did.

Used asset to print into Texture2D - Pixel Tracery v.0.3
"Pixel Tracery" is Texture2D extension class that realized drawing into Texture2D.

Have a fun =)
